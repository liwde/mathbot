Render TeX Formulas in Telegram Chats

Once the Telegram Bot (https://t.me/liwde_math_bot) is started, it listens for Messages starting with `/math`, typeset any TeX passed and respond with an image.

The Bot is powered by [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) and supports every command it is capable of. A full list can be found here: http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/tex.html

## Example

```latex
/math \nabla w_{pq}=-\eta\frac{\partial E}{\partial w_{pq}}
```
